# Calculator Application Documentation

This project is a simple calculator application written in Python. It includes basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and exponentiation. The application features a user interface that prompts the user to select an operation and input two numeric values.

## Files and their purpose:

- `arithmetic_operations.py`: Implements the arithmetic operations.
- `input_validation.py`: Provides a function to validate if the input is numeric.
- `user_interface.py`: Manages the user interface and integrates operation functions.
- `main.py`: The entry point of the application, containing the main loop.
- `test_*.py`: Test files for unit, integration, and end-to-end testing.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists the dependencies for the project.

## Usage:

Run `main.py` to start the calculator application. Follow the prompts to perform arithmetic operations.

## Testing:

Unit tests can be run using the pytest framework. Ensure that pytest is installed and run `pytest` in the project directory.
